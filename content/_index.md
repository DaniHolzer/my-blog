# Welcome

Welcome to my tech blog.

This space is a living journal of my journey into software engineering — from learning fundamentals to building real-world projects.
Here, I share milestones, lessons learned, and thoughts that matter along the way.

Whether you’re self-teaching, transitioning into tech, or just curious about how developers grow, you’re in the right place. -->
