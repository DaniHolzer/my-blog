# Hi, I'm Daniel
a self-taught software engineering student from South Tyrol.

I started learning software development from home two years ago, following a
structured but independent path. My main learning resources have been Udemy
courses and CompTIA certifications, which helped me build a strong technical foundation.

So far, I've worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS.
I enjoy turning ideas into clean, functional interfaces and continuously
improving my skills one step at a time.

I created this blog to document my progress, share important insights, and
reflect on the journey of becoming a software engineer - honestly, openly,
and in real time.
