# My Blog

This repository contains the source code for my personal tech blog.

The blog is a place where I document my journey into software engineering -- sharing milestones,
lessons learned and important thoughts along the way.
It serves both as a learning journal and a resource for others who
are self-teaching or transitioning into tech.

## About the Project

- Personal tech blog / learning journal  
- Focused on web development and software engineering  
- Built while learning and improving step by step  

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- TailwindCSS
- JavaScript
- React
- TypeScript

## Motivation

I started learning software engineering from home two years ago using online courses 
and certifications. This blog exists to:
- Track my progress publicly  
- Reflect on what I learn  
- Share insights that might help others on a similar path  

## Status

This project is actively evolving as I continue learning and building.
